Replace mysql-connector-java driver version for matchin your mysql-server

- my solution was change from 8.0.11 to 5.1.49, because I continue develop project in computer where mysql-server version is different. See screenshot of this error.

https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java





Backup database:

mysqldump -u root -p fullstack2022db1 > productDatabase1_backup1.sql




- as you can see this underline product-table version is generated buy springboot. So I modified my Product-modelclass to use autogenerated one and database search begin working
